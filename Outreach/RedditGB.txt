**Important Information Regarding the GB:**

* You will have 1 week after the closing of the GB to pay the invoice. After that, I will select others to replace your spot, and those selected will have 3 days to pay the invoice.
* I do have a MOQ of about 35 technically, but hopefully we hit that.
* Expected 2 month fulfillment time after GB is closed and invoices are paid, 3-4 months if things get delayed.

**Function96v2 Features:**

* Case and PCB design are all from yours truly (Thanks to the Keyboard Atelier Discord for all their help)

* Top/Burger Mount, with gaskets for burger mount rather than o-rings.
* 6 degree typing angle.
* Added an aesthetic cut along the top
* Engraved JTM Logo on the bottom
* Comes standard with a black or clear hardcoat anodization. Cerakotes and Guncandy will be addons, price will directly determined by the coater's quote (I won't be profiting off of cerakotes at all).
* Blockers between bottom mods and arrow keys to support non-visual navigation (biggest issue with all other 96% layouts).
* Blockers added for F-Row Keys for the same reason as stated above.
* ISO Support
