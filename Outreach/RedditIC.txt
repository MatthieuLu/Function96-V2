***Introducing the Function96 v.2, the Board Designed by an Engineer for Engineers, Accountants, and Anyone Who Needs A Numpad***

A 96% layout for everyone looking for a premium 96% keyboard offered nowhere else!

**Important Information Regarding V2:**

* V2's Groupbuy will run from Nov 20 - 29.
* V2's Groupbuy is limited to 50 units.
* V2's price is currently set at $400 + shipping (~25$) not including options like cerakote and mill-max.
* V2's Groupbuy will have 7/50 units reserved for V1 members who can give away their spot if they'd like.

**Features:**

* Case and PCB design are all from yours truly (Thanks to the Keyboard Atelier Discord for all their help) 
* Completely Screwless Exterior
* Top/Burger Mount, with gaskets for burger mount rather than o-rings.
* 6 degree typing angle.
* Comes standard with a black or clear hardcoat anodization. Cerakotes and Guncandy will be addons, price will directly determined by the coater's quote (I won't be profiting off of cerakotes at all).
* Blockers between bottom mods and arrow keys to support non-visual navigation (biggest issue with all other 96% layouts).
* Blockers added for F-Row Keys for the same reason as states above.
